# An example of use

# Dan Shocker, The Electrifying Fist
**Notes:**  
This is a champion concept I created in little time, with the purpose of serving as an example to the use of the template.  
It is a champion who fights with punches charged by lightning.

## Brief Description
A young man, about 20 or so, of athletic complexion. His white hair is his most notable trait, for it crackles with electricity.

## Lore
Not much for lore, he could be someone amplified by Piltovian hextech or someone empowered by the elemental magics of Ixtal.  
Personality-wise, someone prone to impulsive decisions, who'd rather talk with fists than words.

## Abilities

### Innate: Ride The Lightning
*Charge Up:*  
Your secondary bar is a *Charge* meter. It slowly builds up during combat, gaining extra *Charge* by hitting enemy champions.  
The *Charge* meter depletes while out of combat or Immobilized.  

*Ride The Lightning:*  
The *Charge* meter starts rapidly depleting after it reaches its max capacity, and you become unstoppable and gain bonus movement
speed based on your level.  
The cooldown of your basic abilities is reset when this triggers, and *Forward Shock* has its cooldown significantly reduced for
the duration.

**Notes:**  
An innate ability meant to cement his charge-first, then become unleashed lightning gameplay.

### Q: Forward Shock
*First Cast:*  
Dash a short distance forward, briefly becoming untargetable, passing through enemies and obstacles and punching the nearest enemy,
prioritizing champions.  
Enemies passed through are briefly slowed.  
If an enemy champion is passed through and then punched, they are stunned and take additional damage from the punch.

**Notes:**  
First active ability designed.  
Aims to provide both mobility and durability.

### W: The Face Wrecker
*First & Second Cast:*  
Throw three rapid punches forward, dealing damage to all enemies in a line.  
This ability may be casted up to three times, with no more than 2s between casts, before going on cooldown.  
*Third Cast:*  
Launch a lightning blast covering a larger conical area.  
Enemies take increased damage for each barrage they've been hit during this cast.  
If used during Forward Shock, it'll aim at the punched enemy.

**Notes:**  
An ability meant to deal damage and synergize with Forward Shock.

### E: Redirect Static
*First Cast:*  
Gather the essence of lightning from your surroundings for 0.5s, then unleash it around you to damage surrounding enemies.  
Enemy champions and large monsters hit are marked, becoming visible for 3s.  
You gain increased attack speed against marked targets.

**Notes:**  
I didn't really know what to put here, so this ended being a fancy attack steroid.

### R: Lightning Echo
*Passive:*  
Gain increased *Charge* when hitting enemy champions with your abilities.  
*First Cast:*  
Gain a 33%/66%/100% *Charge* and create an ethereal double of yourself made entirely of lightning, lasting until you leave combat.  
Your lightning double follows you and echoes all your abilities after a brief delay.  
Echoed abilities deal reduced damage and apply all their other effects.  

**Notes:**  
I consider the gameplay of this champion fairly self-contained on his basic abilities.
Thus, his ultimate aims at bringing those to higher heights.
