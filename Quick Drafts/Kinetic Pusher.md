# Kinetic Pusher (unnamed)

## Brief Description
Close range mage who manipulates kinetic force to push enemies around. Created in less than an hour starting with a Design Challenge.
I started creating it on discord chat here: https://discordapp.com/channels/322045075700056064/322046252298534914/741798155636703262

## Abilities

### Passive: Weightless Step
Attacking an immobilized enemy champion causes you to dash to them, dealing bonus damage and knocking them up.
This has a per-unit CD.

### Q: Gravity Orb
Launch an orb forward, dealing minor damage and slowing enemies on the way, then stopping at target position, further slowing enemies within range.
The sphere explodes after a fixed delay (instant if cast at full range, longer if cast melee), damaging, heavily slowing and marking enemy champions.
If the explosion hits a marked champion, they are briefly stunned.

### W: Kinetic Push
After a brief delay, knock back all enemies in a circular area in front of you, dealing them damage.
Airborne enemies aren't knocked back and take largely increased damage.

### E: Singularity
Surround yourself with a heavy repelling force, slowing nearby enemies and gaining large damage reduction against projectiles.
After a set amount of time the Singularity collapses, dealing major damage to enemies in a small area around you, and reduced damage to enemies in a larger area.

### R: Heavy Gravity
Creates an area that slows enemies within for 6s, unleashing a Gravity Pulse in the process.
Can be recast 0/1/2 times over the duration to unleash a Gravity Pulse.
Gravity Pulse: Damages and briefly slows and grounds enemies in the area, knocking down and dealing bonus damage to dashing enemies.
