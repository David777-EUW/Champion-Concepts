# Piltovian Mercenary (unnamed)

## Brief Description
Mercenary from Piltover whose only loyality is to the coin.

## Abilities

### Passive: Piltover's Hired Gun
**Bounty Hunt:** All your abilities can be upgraded once. Every 4k gold you earn grants you one ability upgrade.  
**Target analysis:** Your attacks inflict champions and large monsters with a mark, up to two, lasting for a while.
Targets with full marks are *Vulnerable* and take bonus damage from you.
Successive attacks and abilities against a *Vulnerable* target refresh the marks duration.

### Q: Bullet Barrage
**Active:** Attack rapidly three times in a cone, each attack damaging the first enemy it hits.
These behave like normal attacks, being able to critically strike, apply lifesteal and on-hit effects.
Multiple attacks on a single target deal reduced damage.
This ability can be recast once after a brief delay.  
**Upgrade:** Shoots five times with increased range.  

### W: Aimed Shot
**Active:** Unleash a powerful shot at the target champion, damaging them and all enemies on a line.
If the main target is the first to get hit by this ability, they take bonus damage.  
**Upgrade:**  Briefly stuns the primary target.

### E: Phase Belt
**Active:** Activate your *Phase Belt* with a direction.
After 1.5s delay, blink a fixed distance in the marked direction. Cannot be cast while immobilized or grounded.  
**Upgrade:** Can store two charges, and gain a short lasting shield after blinking.

### R: Search and Destroy
**Active:** Send up to 4 missiles to your nearest enemies (one missile per enemy), prioritizing *Vulnerable* targets, dealing damage in a small area upon impact.  
**Upgrade:** Missiles will deal bonus damage based on missing HP to *Vulnerable* targets.
