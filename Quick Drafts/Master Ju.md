# Master Ju
Yeah the name is an afterthought, so what.

## Brief Description
A DUDE WHO PUNCH BIG. SIMPLE AS.

## Lore
Legends speak of a Ionian man who once tried to bring equilibrium by focusing his training to deliver the strongest punches.
Eventually, he was able to channel his own power as well as the power of the land, and his fists were able to torn the earth asunder.

## Abilities

### Innate: Fists of Ionian Might
*Passive:* Your first attack against an enemy deals significant bonus magic damage, with a per-target cooldown, and grants a shield, with a target-independent cooldown.
Hitting an enemy with an ability reduces this cooldown on them.

**Notes:** So I decided to make him a Ionian, as they focus on spirit and self-training, but gave him a more brutish take on Ionian teachings.
The bonus magic damage is meant to both allow him to hit past armor as well as to tie his ability combo together.
His gameplay revolves around properly combining this with the rest of his kit to maximize his damage and survivability.
Yes this passive is really similar to Vi's, so what.

### Q: Overbearing Strength
*First Cast:* Your next 3 attacks deal bonus damage, have bonus range, strike all enemies in a line and don't scale with bonus AS.
The last attack deals double damage and always applies the Innate's bonus damage and grants its shield.

**Notes:** This was designed last. I felt some more consistent damage was needed on the kit.
So an attack attack steroid became the Q and a shield was added to the Innate.
The idea was to make it still feel big and punchy so an AoE version of his punches with extra damage felt it clicked.
I also thought about making a 1-2 rush and punch ability till I realized that was literally Sett's Q. (oops)

### W: Pummel
*First Cast:* Channel the spirits of Ionia through your fists, punching a small area within 600-ish range with an ethereal fist coming off the air, stunning enemies hit.
This doesn't interrupt your attack or movement.

**Notes:** Ain't this cool? Ain't this really, really cool?
I honestly love it.
Punch, but with magic, and it stuns.
It's basically the core thematic, but with the Ionian spin.
Plus it really helps with an otherwise hard to land combo.

### E: Dash and Smash
*First Cast:* Dash forward while throwing a forward punch, stopping at max range or when you hit an enemy champion, damaging them.
Then follow up with a wide punch, damaging and slowing enemies in a cone.

**Notes:** A normal mobility dash, but with punches.
Added some CC to top off, but it's not the most important part of this ability.
It'd work equally well if the second punch had extra damage rather than CC.
And again, similar to Vi, but this one's big selling point is the second punch, so not really.

### R: Sunder the Land
*First Cast:* Ready your strongest punch over 0.75s, becoming unstoppable, moving at reduced speed and taking reduced damage.
Then, unleash the punch in front of you, massively damaging and stunning enemies, and knocking back yourself and all enemies hit in your facing direction, tearing apart the terrain and space where you hit.
For 10s, no champion or projectile can move or dash through.

**Notes:** The first piece in the kit I designed, it had to be a punch as big as possible.
I believe I delivered.
