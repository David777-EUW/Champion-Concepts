# Crasus, Shield of Seekers
## Fantasy
Hailing from Noxus, this man was more interested in knowledge than conflict, so he moved to Piltover.
He founded the Ruin Reconaissance Company, which handles logistics for explorers, helping them on their way to whatever ruins, as well as providing on-site support.
He uses his post to join the explorers on their journeys and gather whatever valuable knowledge may be available on the ruins.
So far, all his patrons returned alive and in a single piece.

## Design goals
Create a champion mobile that exhibits thirst for knowledge, desire to protect and the characteristic Noxian ruthlessness.
Mostly a support, but would be great if it had solo capabilities.
Feels a gun would be a great tool to equip, whilst keeping a dagger as main weapon

### [P] Rune-engraved Dagger
A token found on some ruins from a patron long ago for saving their lives.
Per champion or Â¿large monster? affected with your ability casts, you generate a charge of runic energy, up to two.
Your attacks spend one charge to ~~dash a small distance to your target,~~ dealing bonus magic damage.
Store the pre-mitigation damage dealt by this, expending it to heal yourself and your allies with your next ability cast.
* Intended to be workable for solo laning, but optimized for an aggressive support playstyle
* Abilities should be made to have instantaneous effect and most likely be able to hit multiple champions if picking a good enough shot to properly synergize with this

### [Q] Trick Shot
Shot with your gun on the target direction after a small wind-up. The shot impacts with the first enemy, dealing physical damage.
The bullet shots a blast of runic energy in the shot direction, dealing magic damage to the primary target and enemies behind them (The runic blast is wider and shorter than the primary shot).
If it doesn't hit anyone, the bullet shots the blast at maximum range after a delay.
* Someone with Noxian connections, a bit of cash and a risky job would like a trusty sidearm for when things get heated. Add some bullets found on the ruins for extra bang.
* Simple poke ability, but with an AoE component meant to get the most out of the passive.

### [W] Adhesive Bomb
Throw a clump of concentrated adhesive to the ground, where it covers a moderate area.
Enemies initially hit are increasingly slowed for 1.5s, getting rooted for 1s as the adhesive solidifies.
* Utility, easing placement of Q, and setting up plays for allies. Probably short range to require a more aggressive play to effectively use this.

### [E] Safe Passage
Dart towards the target ally, granting bot of you a decent shield for 2s. (Can be self cast, probably)
After your shield expires, dash back to your original position, uncovering a passage that your ally can follow.
If you're immobilized, the dash back will be delayed as long as you're immobilized.
* The original ability, from which the fantasy then everything else originated, and creates interesting gameplay.
* Two usage scenarios: 
	- Use it to get close to an ally to assist them, trying your best not to get your shield popped.
	- Use it to get an ally to safety, putting yourself at risk to get your shield popped asap.

### [R] Dagger Shadow
Throw your dagger forward, stopping at the first enemy champion, dealing physical damage, marking them and teleporting behind them.
Throwing the dagger at an unmarked enemy allows this ability to be recast within 10s. Marks last until this ability goes into CD. (Potentially up to 6 casts before CD not counting clones)
* Moved mobilty from passive and made this.
* This plays to the support kit primarily as a source of mobility and passive stacks; to the laner kit as a way to close in on the target and burst it down faster by quickly tapping them twice.

## Retired Abilities
### [W] Smokebomb
Throw a small barrel at the target position, which explodes. Enemies in the area take minor magic damage and are slowed, enemies in the center take bonus physical damage and are blinded.
* Great for gameplay, but throwing a smokebomb within a ruin sounds like a terrible idea. INSTAYEET
